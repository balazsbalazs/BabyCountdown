Five weeks is a common time when moms-to-be find out they’re pregnant (though some won’t discover it for a couple more weeks still). That’s because by now you probably realized you’ve missed your period. Plus, heightened pregnancy hormone levels may be giving you some symptoms that are tough to ignore, like sore breasts, nausea and fatigue. (Those same hormones are the ones your pregnancy test picked up to give you a positive result.) These are just the beginning of the slew of changes your body is about to go through. No need to worry though: many moms-to-be say the first trimester was the toughest part of pregnancy, so you’re probably getting the rough stuff out of the way early. In the meantime, be sure to take care of yourself and get plenty of rest, eat right and test out some ways to deal with the queasies (eating small, more frequent meals is one good one). Maybe even ask your partner for a massage. After all, you might not have a big bump, but at five weeks pregnant, your body is working fast and furiously to grow baby, so you deserve a little TLC, right?
