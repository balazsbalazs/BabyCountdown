Congratulations! If you know you're four weeks pregnant, you found out the news earlier than most women probably do -- and you might be totally excited, or you might be still getting used to the idea. Either way, it’s likely you’re not feeling any different (for now, at least), since most early pregnancy symptoms have not have kicked in yet. Be sure to celebrate this amazing news with your partner but don't tell the world yet. Your first call is to your doctor to schedule your first prenatal visit when they can confirm your pregnancy. And even though your baby-to-be is still tiny, he’s already undergoing important development at week four of pregnancy, so start taking a prenatal vitamin. Look for one with at least 400 micrograms of folic acid and remember to take it daily. We know you’ve got a lot on your mind, but since folic acid is proven to help prevent birth defects, this is super important!
